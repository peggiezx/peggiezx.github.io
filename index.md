# Hello World!

My name is Xun, and I go by Peggie. I come from Chengdu, home of cute panda bears and one of the liveliest city in China. I began my self-taught programming journey during my current job when the startup team needed someone to build the website. I love to challenge myself with new projects and create beautiful performant products for everyone. Currently I am pursing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University.
