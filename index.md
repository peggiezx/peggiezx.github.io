# Hello World!

My name is Xun, but you can call me Peggie. I come from Chengdu, home of cute panda bears and one of the liveliest cities in China.

I’ve been programming for four years, ever since my current startup needed someone to build their website and I took on the challenge. I’ve tried to explore many areas of software and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University.

I’m looking for opportunities to challenge myself while building beautiful, performant products.
